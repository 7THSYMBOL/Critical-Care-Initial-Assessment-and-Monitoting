## Critical Care Data the Acutely ill  


Patients who are admitted to hospital believe that they are entering a place of safety, where they, and their families and carers, have a right to believe that they will receive the best possible care. They feel confident that, should their condition deteriorate, they are in the best place for prompt and effective treatment.

Yet there is evidence to the contrary. Patients who are, or become, acutely unwell in hospital may receive suboptimal care. This may be because their deterioration is not recognised, or because – despite indications of clinical deterioration – it is not appreciated, or not acted upon sufficiently rapidly. Communication and documentation are often poor, experience might be lacking and provision of critical care expertise, including admission to critical care areas, delayed.

## Identifying patients whose clinical condition is deteriorating or is at risk of deterioration

Physiological track and trigger systems should be used to monitor all adult patients in acute hospital settings.

  -Physiological observations should be monitored at least every 12 hours, unless a decision has been made at a senior level to increase or decrease this frequency for an individual patient.

  -The frequency of monitoring should increase if abnormal physiology is detected, as outlined in the recommendation on graded response strategy.
