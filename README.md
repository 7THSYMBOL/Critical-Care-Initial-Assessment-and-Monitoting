## Identifying patients whose clinical condition is deteriorating or is at risk of deterioration

Physiological track and trigger systems should be used to monitor all adult patients in acute hospital settings.

  -Physiological observations should be monitored at least every 12 hours, unless a decision has been made at a senior level to increase or decrease this frequency for an individual patient.

  -The frequency of monitoring should increase if abnormal physiology is detected, as outlined in the recommendation on graded response strategy.
